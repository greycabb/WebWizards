# Web Wizards 

## Overview of Project

Web Wizards is a web application that allows children to learn web development through the use of a simple drag-and-drop interface without the current challenges of typing, navigating a computer, and remembering syntax. Users are able to drag customizable blocks to build their websites with their own personalized design. By creating new websites and interacting with the application, users can earn points to unlock new avatars.

## Summary of Technology Decisions
We used Node.js FILL THIS OUT HERE

We used React.js to make our application. This is because almost anyone who is interested in wanting to create websites will have a computer that will have a web browser that can run it. As it is a website, nothing will have to be downloaded so it will be accessible from school computers which sometimes do not allow applications to be downloaded.

React.js has many packages that can be installed that allow for many useful technologies such as unit testing which we used in our app. The web framework with its states also makes development easier as base JavaScript is notoriously hard to manage for complex applications. Reactâ€™s babel functionality means that we can use modern JS techniques even on older machines which is useful since many schools still use older browsers. 

We chose Golang because of group's familiarity with how the database works. In addition to Golang, we used MongoDB because it is easy to store different types of structures, including complex, nested objects. This was imperative for the complexity of block and project storage.
